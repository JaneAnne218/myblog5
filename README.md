A blog theme for [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev)

I was looking for a VitePress blog that had a fair bit of features. Decided to try to put together my own and see what happens. Having fun coding along the way ðŸ˜€

## Features

- Blog with Posts, Authors, Tags, Categories
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for Styling
- No HTML needed in posts or authors pages

## Instructions

Coming soon...
